# Overview

Describe the motivation behind your desired functionality.

How would you like the user experience for this feature to work?

# Proposal

Describe what changes need to be implemented to resolve this issue. Be as
detailed as possible so maintainers can best determine how to implement this
new feature.

## Supplementary Information

To give your feature more chance at being implemented, feel free to attach any
other documentation. For something highly-user facing, a UI mock-up or some
other form of wireframe is required.
