# Background

Provide context for the issue you want redesigned (i.e. screenshots, gifs, link to ticket)
and add a label for the relevent team (Engineering, Design, Product).

# Proposal

Describe what changes need to be implemented to resolve this issue. Be as
detailed as possible so maintainers can best determine how to implement this
redesign.

## Supplementary Information

To give your redesign more chance at being implemented, feel free to attach any
other documentation. For something highly-user facing, a UI mock-up or some
other form of wireframe is required.
