## Getting Started

Developed using Python 3.10, on MacOS. `annotations` import probably no longer needed after 3.11.

Redis is used as a shared, persistent storage solution for Flask-Limiter ratelimiting.

## File Index

`api.py` contains Flask server code for the API. It consumes `solver.py`.

`solver.py` contains a `GraduationRequirementsSolver` class which loads/parses a requirements definition file, then
uses max flow to solve it.

`solver_test.py` contains some example code on how to use the solver.

`mock_data.py` contains `MockData`, which serves some mock courses (degree plans) and CS requirement set. The CS
requirement set is outdated. **This may eventually be removed.**

`utils.py` contains shared dependencies of `solver.py` and `maxflow.py`, i.e. container classes for courses and
requirements, as well as Matcher logic.

## Requirement design and limitations

### Representing requirements

Based on Orion, each requirement has an hour requirement and a total # of courses requirement. However, as far as I
can tell the "number of courses" requirement is useless. So, each requirement can be thought of as a set of rules
that determine what courses can satisfy that requirement, and the total number of hours that must be used to do so.

Requirements contain trees of `Matcher` nodes.

Some leaf nodes:

- NameList: match course name to a list of possible courses
- Regex: match course name to regex pattern
- Level: match course level (usually first digit)
- Any: returns true

Some non-leaf nodes:

- And, Or: self-explanatory

Stacking these together makes it pretty robust in determining whether a course is capable of filling a requirement.

#### Representing electives as requirements

Any requirement can be represented by a comprehensive name list, but this is not very scalable. Instead, electives are
represented with the "Not" matcher. For example, CS guided electives are "Not" CS preparatory courses "Or" CS core
courses, while also being ("And") "Level" 3 or 4 CS "Department" classes.

As seen above, matchers can be re-used as components of other matchers, because everything is a tree :)

One potential optimization is to cache the results of each matcher with each course, so that the same sub-tree does
not need to be traversed multiple times across different checks. This optimization is left un-implemented because
the matching algorithm is already quite fast.

### Requirement groups

We also know that some courses cannot be repeated between requirement groups. For example, a 010 cannot be
double-dipped as a 090 core, while MATH 2417 _can_ be double-dipped in both the core curriculum and CS curriculum.
To handle this, break requirements up into "requirement groups", where courses cannot be used to fill more than one
requirement per requirement group. I'm pretty sure this is how Orion does it, because it separates out all the
double-dip courses into their own separate requirements from the "CS Preparatory" requirement.

Some examples to illustrate:

- The set of core curriculum classes, major-required courses (which are not allowed to overlap with core curriculum),
  guided electives, and free electives. Note that we must extract stuff like MATH 2413/MATH 2417 and ECS 3390 to a
  separate requirement outside of the major requirements, because these are also used to satisfy the core curriculum.
- The Upper Level Hour Requirement states you must take, in total, 51 upper-level courses. This by itself is a
  requirement group, because classes used by this requirement can also be used by any other requirement.

### Manual assignments (Bypasses)

Sometimes, we may want to manually assign a course to a requirement. For example, to specify what would be an arbitrary
choice to the algorithm, or to allow something that doesn't normally happen. One common example of this is replacing
CS 1136 with hours from a different CS course.

Each bypass is a triple containing a course, a requirement, and a number of hours to assign.

Bypasses can be simply handled without changing the core assignment problem, by adding the below pre-processing and
post-processing steps:

1. Pre-process: For every bypass, remove the hours from both the course and the requirement.
2. Solve the remaining problem normally
3. Post-process: Add the bypass assignments to the solution

> For now, no warnings have been implemented. If users try to over-assign, the algorithm allows them to do so and

## Max flow design and limitations

We want to allocate courses toward requirement groups in such a way that minimizes the number of unused courses. This
optimization problem can be done with max flow.

here is a pretty good writeup of how to re-think course allocation as maximum flow in a bipartite graph:

### Course Splitting

However, Dartmouth works on a trimester system and all of their courses are 1 hour. So, they don't need to worry
about splitting course hours between requirements.

> Note: Splitting is different from double-dipping.  
> An example of splitting would be apply 1 hour from CS 2417 to Requirement A, and the other 3 to Requirement B.  
> An example of double-dipping would be to apply all 4 hours from CS 2417 to Requirement A, and also to Requirement B.

There's no hard rule on how much we can split courses, so the easy solution is to split each course into mutiple
1-hour courses with the same properties. Then, simplify the network by joining equivalent nodes. This gives you the
same graph, but with source links having capacity equivalent to the number of credit hours in each course.

> Todo: draw a diagram of what this looks like

However, optimal solutions to this max flow problem have no concept of wanting to keep courses together. Imagine a
situation where courses A and B are both 2 hours, while requirements X and Y can each be filled by either. You can
assign A to X and B to Y, A to Y and B to X, or _half of each course to each requirement_! Obviously this last one is
kind of weird, even though it is technically optimal.

We can introduce a second optimization: Find the minimal subgraph of the maximum flow graph which still acheives the
same flow. In other words, maximiuze the course-requirement edges with 0 flow. In other words, add a constant fixed cost
to each course-requirement edge used in the solution, and minimize the flow cost.

Unfortunately, solving the Minimum-Edge Cost Flow (MECF) problem is NP-hard, even for bipartite matching with 0/1
costs. More work needs to be done to optimize this second problem in an efficient manner.

### Fractional hours

THe modified push-relabel algorithm supported by Google OR tools only does integer increments of flow, so if you
have a fractional bypass, it may not come up with a full solution (unless the solution can be achieved with only
integer flows).

The fix is to multiply every capacity by some granularity factor, turning all fractions into integers. The current
granularity factor is 100, meaning any hour assignment with 2 or fewer decimal places is supported.

In very preliminary tests, this works well and very quickly, without degrading course splitting performance.
