# Documentaition

## API

Sorry! No comprehensive API documentation :)  
This is will probably change a lot. For now it's quite simple so just look inside `api.py`.

## Outline of Deployment

This isn't the only way to deploy the API, just one way that is hopefully not horrible.

Cloudflare serves as DNS, and has SSL encryption mode set
to [Full (Strict)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-configuration/ssl-modes/full-strict/). Both CF and Nginx
are configured to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.

On the server itself, Nginx is configured with 
[ssl_verify_client](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_verify_client) enabled. The only 
configured client cert is the one from Cloudflare, meaning Nginx will reject connections from other clients. This 
forces all traffic to go through Cloudflare.
