## About

### Overview

Nebula Web allows students to plan out including coursework, co-curricular
activities like studying abroad and research, and extracurricular involvement in
student organizations. It does this with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
that represents various college activities as blocks and displays them in semester
groups.

### Inspiration

Planning coursework poses a challenge for many.

From choosing the right professors to knowing when to take a class, schedule
planning is the bane of any college student.

UTD students have access to tools like [UTD Grades](https://utdgrades.com) and
Rate My Professors to help them pick classes for a specific semeester, but
there hasn't been a solution that allows a student to say, "I want to major in
CS, minor in psychology, and do a few internships before grad school. Generate a
plan lets me do all of that with the professors I want."

Until now, that is.

Nebula Web is an integrated solution designed to help students plan out
their entire undergraduate experience in one place. It allows students to focus
on ensuring their college experience holistically suits their desires and
optimize for long-term success.

### Features

- Drag-and-drop interface for planning coursework by semester for any degree plan
