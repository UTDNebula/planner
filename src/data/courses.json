These organisms known for their simplicity of structure and gene similarity to humans have been seminal in advancing our understanding of many biological processes and human diseases. In this inquiry-based course, learners will apply basic principles of genetic model systems, transmission genetics, and molecular genetics to investigate important biological concepts such as embryonic cell division, stem cells and regeneration, Mendelian inheritance, gene mutations, and phenotypes. Throughout this exploratory course, students will gain practical hands-on experience conducting basic culturing, genetic manipulation and phenotypic analysis necessary to utilize genetic model organisms in their investigation. Learners will engage in class",

The second aim is to employ those methods in understanding aggregate empirical regularities as they pertain to economic growth with standard modern macroeconomic theory. Therefore, primary course aims include a thorough discussion of non-stochastic dynamics and optimization. Next, using these methods, exogenous and endogenous growth applications that illustrate the applied general equilibrium analyses that comprise modern macroeconomic growth theory are discussed. The course concludes with an introduction to non-stochastic overlapping generations models and discusses the role of dynamic efficiency in macroeconomic theory. (3-0) Y",

    "description": "IPEC 4302 - Political Economy of Developing Countries (3 semester credit hours) We typically assume that democracy is good for economic growth. But if this is the case, how do we explain China's economic success? Similarly, economic theory states that governments should not interfere with the market, but why did South Korea industrialize at an incredible pace by doing exactly that while Argentina failed miserably? Why are natural resources a blessing in Botswana but a curse in Nigeria? If we have learned anything from developing countries' experiences, it is that there is no universal \"one-size-fits-it-all\" answer. This course explores the conditions under which grand theories of development are valid. It is crucial to take these differences in local conditions into account when developing policy recommendations or investment strategies. Using case studies in every class, this course offers students opportunities to sharpen their analytical skills to make sense of a complicated world. (3",

Students will explore the origins of evolution theory, public misconceptions, teaching, and evolution education research. An intensive scientific argumentation component (rather than debate) through discourse, advanced readings, presentations, panel discussions, and formal writing is required. Viewpoints examined include those of evolutionary biologists and research scientists. (3-0) T",

How can different diseases affect identical twins sharing the same genetic information? Why our parents and grandparents' diet and health may have lasting influences on our own health? The field of epigenetics emerged over the past decades to tackle these fundamental questions that intersect our genome, development, environment, and disease. The course will provide a broad overview of epigenetic phenomena and epigenetic mechanisms with weekly lectures and small group discussions of primary literature. The course will introduce students to seminal works in epigenetics and recent developments with the goal of instilling critical knowledge of the field.",

What metrics define the \"targets\" of economic development strategies? What comprises success? What evidence lends support and encouragement for such efforts? Using selected case studies of economic development projects and programs, we will evaluate available evidence for indications of the success with which economic development efforts have achieved their intended goals. Finally, we will explore the prospects for a re-imagined economic development toolkit oriented less to rejuvenate and restore past capabilities and more to facilitate the transit to new roles and opportunities.

The course also examines issues related to the relationship between science and politics. For example, does science promote democracy, and vice versa? Lastly, the course addresses important contemporary topics related to climate change, biotechnology and genetic engineering, artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, and other topics, with the aim of examining the science-technology-society nexus.

This course explores the politics of natural resources in both industrialized and developing countries. We analyze the effect of natural resources on a variety of economic and political issues, including growth, macroeconomic stability, corruption, civil war, women's rights, and democracy. During this process, we also focus on how political institutions and economic conditions shape the effect of natural resources. This allows us to understand why natural resources may have positive effects in some instances, but a negative in others. (3-0) T",

To understand the idea of the involvement of all body systems in the seemingly \"local\" manifestations of a disease, and to realize the importance of the mind-body connections in the subjective and objective characteristics of an individual ailment and its influence on the process of sanogenesis (recovery).

Similarly, a music service like Spotify may want to know what kinds of promotions will help increase the number of subscribers in the most effective way.

    "description": "BA 1310 - Making Choices in Free Market Systems (3 semester credit hours) An introduction to decision making in the free market system. Models from economic and decision sciences provide a foundational understanding of how people make choices - as consumers, employees, managers, and citizens. We explore how the creative destruction of the marketplace expands social wealth, creating gains for some individuals and losses for others. Debates, case studies and simulations, introduce the psychological, social norm, and moral factors that influence how markets work and how, as a society, we interact with markets and the limitations that we sometimes impose on markets and choice.

The key similarity of these models is that they involve dependent variables that violate one or more of the assumptions of the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model. The main models examined in the course are binary logit and probit, multinomial logit, ordinal probit, tobit, and the family of Poisson regression models. All these models are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). The Heckman correction for selection is also addressed. Recommended: EPPS 6316 or the equivalent. (3-0) T",
